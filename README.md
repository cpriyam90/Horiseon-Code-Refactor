# Horiseon-Code-Refactor

Based on the needs of the marketing agency, the following is a refactoring of the code for Horiseon website. 

## User Story
   * AS A marketing agency
   * I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
   * SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## Criteria

The elements of the HTML and CSS style sheet were reorganized to meet the scenario-oriented criteria as set forth by the cient.
The criteria is as follows:

* GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
* WHEN I view the source code
* THEN I find semantic HTML elements
* WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
* THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* WHEN I view the image elements
* THEN I find accessible alt attributes
* WHEN I view the heading attributes
* THEN they fall in sequential order
* WHEN I view the title element
* THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

Additionally, the CSS style sheet was edited to include comments, and the structure was rearranged to match the HTMl elements. The links were checked for functionality as well.

## Usage

The main purpose of this refactoring is to increase accessibility. The increased accessibility will improve the search engine optimization of the website and its readibility to users with disabilities.
